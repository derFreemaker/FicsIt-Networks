= Basic Types
:description: All basic Lua data types all kind of apis and components use.

You can use all normal Lua data-types but FicsIt-Networks uses mainly userdata-types to have custom data types. +
These datatype accomplish a variety of different things otherwise very annoying to implement as an API.

== Reflection-System Types
For each Type/Class or Struct registered in the xref:BasicConcept.adoc#_reflection_system[Reflection-System] there is its own type loaded (dynamically when actually used) that exposes the functions and properties of that type to the lua environment. +
This is done by using metatables to provide some data-type functionality like a name and indexing.
The overwritten indexing functionality is then used to search for functions and properties accordingly. +
Such types are also known as `Classes` throughout this documentation.
A value of such a type is also known as `Instance` or `Reference` to a object.

You can access these functions and properties like you do in normal tables (a period `.` or array operator `[]`).

=== Additional Fields
Is a Instance additionally a network Component, which is not directly class, then it has some additional fields:

==== Nick `nick`
The `nick` field is a string field you can read and write to.
It allows you to access the nick of a component which you could also set with the network manager.
One of the main purposes is to read additional data like configurations settings per component from it.

[source,lua]
----
local comp = component.proxy(component.findComponent("machine")[1])
local fields = {}
for key, value in string.gmatch(comp.nick, "(%w+)=([^%s]+)") do
 fields[key] = value
end
-- if there is now a component with the nick "machine setting1=42 setting2=meep"
-- then the fields table will look like {"setting1"="42", "setting2"="meep"}
----

==== ID `id`
The `id` is a read-only string field allowing you to read the UUID of the component.
Mainly intended allowing you to print or display the ID of a component.
For comparing/identifying components,
use the default way of comparing/identifying instances with the hash functions and properties.

[source,lua]
----
local comp = component.proxy(component.findComponent("machine")[1])
print(comp.id) -- prints the ID of the component with a nick group "machine"
----

=== Properties
Properties can be used just normally.
Tho read-only properties will cause a error when you try to assign a value to them
with the assignment `=` operator.

[source,Lua]
----
local constructor = ...
print(constructor.standby) -- get the value of the "standby" property
constructor.standby = true -- set the value of the "standby" property
----

[WARNING]
====
Using Properties that return structs can lead to some common pitfalls.
Structs are returned internally by value, not by reference. This means that if you change the property of a struct you got through a property, you are not changing the struct within the object.

[source,Lua]
----
print(myObj.someStruct.someAttribute) -- Prints: "meep"
myObj.someStruct.someAttribute = "nice"
print(myObj.someStruct.someAttribute) -- Prints: "meep"
----

To prevent this, you store the struct in a variable and then assign it back to the object. Only if the property that returns the struct, is writeable that is.

[source,Lua]
----
print(myObj.someStruct.someAttribute) -- Prints: "meep"
local struct = myObj.someStruct
struct.someAttribute = "nice"
myObj.someStruct = struct
print(myObj.someStruct.someAttribute) -- Prints: "nice"
----

In the future, we intend to remove all struct properties and replace them with getter & setter Functions.
====

=== Functions
Functions are just values as we all know, so they don't have member awareness. +
Tho, you could do this with so call up-values. These are simply values stored within the function value itself.
This is also how f.e. OpenComputers does it.
But this would mean we have to create a new function value every time you access such an instance
and for every instance there is. +
For optimization, mainly in terms of memory, FicsIt-Networks tries to reuse the function values,
but that also means you as user have to tell the function about the instance, so it is aware of it.
So it actually knows with which instance you want to interact with.

You can call those functions now in two ways.

The difficult way (can get optimized):

[source,Lua]
----
local constructor = ...
constructor.getRecipe(constructor) -- calling the function with first parameter beeing the instance explicitly

-- allows for optimizations like this because other wise the system would try to find the function everytime and that takes valuable time
local func = constructor.getRecipe
for i=0,100,1 do
    func(constructor) -- only function call, without the "search" of the function
end
----

The easy way (can not get optimized):

[source,Lua]
----
local constructor = ...
constructor:getRecipe() -- calling the function with first parameter beeing the instance implicitly
----

If a function does only have the `runtime-synchronous`-flag,
then there will only be one xref:lua/BasicTypes.adoc#_future[future-struct] as return value.
The actual return values can then get retrieved from that future.

=== Structs
Structs work in nearly the same way tho they can be converted from and to "normal" tables.

Usually (not all) structs can simply implicitly get converted from a table with string fields of the property name as keys and values of those properties.
When converting from a table to a struct, you don't even have to have the keys, you can just make sure they are in the same order as shown in the reflection-viewer.

[source,Lua]
----
local constuctor = ...
local loc = constructor.location
print(loc.x, loc.y, loc.z) -- prints the x, y and z properties
funcThatNeedsVector({1, 2, 3}) -- array gets converted implicitly to a vector struct with x=1, y=2, z=3
----

== Future

This object allows for sync between the game and the Lua runtime.
The problem is we can't run some functions of the game while being in a Lua tick.
To workaround this, we introduce the Futures.

With these objects you can check if the function you called has finished processing,
you can get the return values if it finished, and you can even wait for it to finish.

With that said, functions which ony have the "runtime synchronous" flag,
won't return their output values directly, instead they will return such a future struct.

=== Functions

The future structure provides a couple of functions allowing you to interact with the synchronization data.

==== `bool canGet()`

This function allows you to check if the return data of the actual function is ready
or just simply if it got executed.

Return Values::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|bool
|bool
|True if the underlying function got executed.
|===

==== `Retvals... get()`

This function allows you to return all the actual return values of the function.
You can call this even multiple times.

Return Values::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Retvals...
|...
|All the different return values the underlying function returned.
|===

==== `Retvals... await()`

This function yields as long as the underlying function didn't get executed.
When it finally executed the function will return all the return values
the function returned just like `Retvals... get()`.

Return Values::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Retvals...
|...
|All the different return values the underlying function returned.
